## How to run the executables
In Linux what you have to do to run any script (let's say the `run_grasp.sh`) and save its output you do it the following way:

```
./run_grasp.sh > grasp.txt
```

Take into account that `grasp.txt` can be any name for a given file, just remember that if running in this way the output name should be explanatory itself, because we want to make sure that what we are checking is in fact either the greedy, grasp with or without local search (i.e. give informative names to outputs).
